## Academic Projects
### Airbnb Price Prediction (Capstone Project)
- **Objective:** To predict Airbnb room prices based on location, amenities, and other factors using 2021 data for New York City.
- **Insights:** Acquired and cleaned Airbnb dataset for 6 prominent US cities, focusing on New York City. Explored data using various visualizations to understand pricing trends and factors influencing prices. Engineered features such as price per night to enhance model performance. Built and evaluated multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, and Gradient Boosting. Used CRISP-DM methodology for project management and model development.
- **Results:** Achieved a test R-squared value of 0.996, indicating strong predictive performance of the models.
- **Impact:** Provides valuable insights for Airbnb hosts to optimize pricing strategies and for travelers to make informed booking decisions.

### Air Quality Analysis in India (Self Project)
- **Objective:** To analyze factors affecting air pollution in India using AQI data. Insights included PM2.5 and PM10 significance, city-wise AQI variations, and COVID-19's impact on AQI. A base ARIMA (3,1,3) model effectively predicted AQI, showcasing skills in data analysis, modeling, and trend identification.
